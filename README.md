		<h3> The Climate Action Plan(Ireland)<h3>
		<br>
		<p>The Climate Action Plan for Ireland was launched on the 21st of December 2022.
		This plan was set out by the irish Government to display their ambition for a renewable lifestyle.
		The kind of changes that can occur include;</p>
		
		<ul>- Transportation </ul>
		<ul>- How we see waste & rubbish.</ul>
		<ul>- Agriculture <ul>
			
		<p>This plans purpose is for carbon budgets to be put in place for less carbon emissions.
		The goal is for carbon emissions to be halved in ireland by the year 2030, and to be brought down 
		to zero by the year 2050. Ireland attempts to accelarate action in response to the climate issues 
		Ireland is dealing with</p>
		<br>
		<h2> What will Ireland do?</h2>
		<p>Ireland may use different methods to carry out their plans</p>
		<p>Miligation: Miligation strategies are used to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses.
			This is often done through the promotion of renewable energy, energy efficiency and 
			sustainable practices such as transportation, industry & agriculture.</p>
			
		<p>Waste Management: Waste management regulations and Circular economy regulations both came into
			effect on the 1st of september 2023, this introduced a waste recovery levy of £10 per tonne(1000kg)
			and a £10 increase to any existing levy to £85 per tonne. This has been applied because levies only 
			apply to black bins,so household members will be forced to reuse and recyle to decrease their total
			waste charge.
			
		<p>Renewable Energy: To promote the transition of greenhouse gases to renewable energy would be a large 
			help of irelands climate. There are many different type of renewable energy that can help ireland in many of 
			its variable sectors such as; solar panels, wind energy(wind turbines), hydro energy and geothermal energy 
			all to reduce the dependence of fossil fuels</p>
